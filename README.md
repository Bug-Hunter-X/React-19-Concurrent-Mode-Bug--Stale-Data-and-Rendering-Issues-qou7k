# React 19 Concurrent Mode Bug: Stale Data and Rendering Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in React 19 related to concurrent rendering.  The issue involves unexpected rendering behavior and stale data when performing complex state updates within the `useTransition` hook.  The provided code showcases the problem and offers a solution. 

## Problem

The core issue lies in the way the `useTransition` hook handles complex or multiple simultaneous state updates.  When updating state multiple times within a `startTransition` callback, React's concurrent rendering might not handle these updates as expected. This can lead to components displaying stale data or failing to reflect changes.  The bug is more pronounced with heavy state changes, interactions with other libraries and complex app states.

## Solution

The solution involves optimizing state updates to reduce complexity and ensure cleaner transitions.  This may involve refactoring state updates, batched updates, or exploring alternative approaches like `useReducer` for more intricate state management.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe the behavior of the increment buttons and the updates displayed on the screen. Note the difference between the simple increment and complex update.
